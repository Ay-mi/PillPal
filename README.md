# Smart Pill Dispenser: PillPal
An automatic pill dispenser using an ESP32 microcontroller.

### Main features:
- To automatically dispense pills based on a pre-set time (acheived using the ESP32 and app)
- To notify the user that the pill has been dispensed (acheived though the app)
- To alert the user when the pill stock has depleted (acheived though the app)

### Challenges:
- To design the mechanical structure of the dispenser
- To set the servo delay so only one pill is dispensed at a time
