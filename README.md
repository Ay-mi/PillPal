# Smart Pill Dispenser: PillPal
For our capstone project, my groupmate and I designed an automatic pill dispenser using an ESP32 microcontroller.

The dispenser has three main features:
- To automatically dispense medicine (acheived using the ESP32)
- To notify the user that the pill has been dispensed (acheived though the app)
- To alert the user when the pill stock has depleted (acheived though the app)
