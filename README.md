# Smart Pill Dispenser: PillPal
An automatic pill dispenser using an ESP32 microcontroller.

### Main features:
- Automatically dispenses pills based on a pre-set schedule
- Notifies the user that the pill has been dispensed (through the app and a speaker on the dispenser)
- Alerts the user when the pill stock has depleted (through the app)

### Challenges:
- Designing the mechanical structure of the dispenser
- Setting the servo delay so that the servo rotates enough so only one pill is dispensed at a time
